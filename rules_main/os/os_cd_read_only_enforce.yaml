  CD media _MUST_ be set to read only.
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Some organizations rely on the use of removable media for storing and sharing data. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable external hard drives to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.
  ====

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Apple has deprecated the use of media mount controls, using these controls may not work as expected. Third party software may be required to fullfill the compliance requirements.
